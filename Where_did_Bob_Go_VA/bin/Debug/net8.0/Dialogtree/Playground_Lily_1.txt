Hi, I’m Lily. I’m not sure how much longer I can pretend I’m okay. Everything feels so overwhelming.

<D00.OP01>
What’s been going on, Lily?
</D00.OP01>
<D00.OP02>
Have you thought about talking to someone about this?
</D00.OP02>
<D00.OP03>
I'm sure a little help from friends would go a long way.

It just feels like everything is falling apart, and I’m so tired.
</D00.01.Text>
<D00.01.OP01>
That sounds really tough. Have you been able to rest at all?
</D00.01.OP01>
<D00.01.OP02>
What’s been making you feel so tired?

I don’t think talking to anyone would change anything. It’s just how I feel.
</D00.02.Text>
<D00.02.OP01>
You don’t have to carry this burden alone, Lily.
</D00.02.OP01>
<D00.02.OP02>
Maybe sharing how you feel could help you understand it better.

<D00.03.Text>
It’s complicated. I don’t want my friends to deal with me.
</D00.03.Text>
<D00.03.OP01>
I’m sure your friends would be happy to help.
</D00.03.OP01>
<D00.03.OP02>
You are no burden; your friends really value your presence.
</D00.03.OP02>

<D00.03.01>
<D00.03.01.Text>
I’m not sure they do. I just get in the way.
</D00.03.01.Text>
</D00.03.01>

<D00.03.02>
<D00.03.02.Text>
Thank you for caring. I’ll think about it.
