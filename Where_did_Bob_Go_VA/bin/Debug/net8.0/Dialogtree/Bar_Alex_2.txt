I’ve been feeling stressed about everything I have to do, and it’s overwhelming.

Just trying to focus on the things I like, but they don’t feel that rewarding anymore.
</D00.03.Text>
<D00.03.OP01>
Maybe it’s time for you to reach out for some help. I’m sure you could feel much better afterwards.

<D00.03.OP02>
Sounds like you’re having a bit of a tough time. Remember to focus on yourself too.
