It feels like I’m just going through the motions, not really living.
</D00.01.Text>
<D00.01.OP01>
That sounds exhausting. Have you thought about taking some time off?
</D00.01.OP01>
<D00.01.OP02>
Have you been able to find things that make you feel alive?

I keep myself busy, but it doesn’t seem to help much.

Maybe taking a break could help you find some clarity.
</D00.02.OP01>
<D00.02.OP02>
Have you tried talking to a friend about how you’re feeling?

Not right now. I have been focusing mainly on work.
</D00.03.Text>
<D00.03.OP01>
I think taking a little break could help you out a lot, 
or maybe reaching out to your friends.
</D00.03.OP01>
<D00.03.OP02>
I’m sure you could find some time off to enjoy life a bit.
