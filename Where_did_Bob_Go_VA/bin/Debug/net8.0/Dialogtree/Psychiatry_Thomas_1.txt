Hey, I’m Thomas, it feels like I’m just stuck in this endless cycle of negativity.

<D00.OP01>
What’s making you feel this way for so long?
</D00.OP01>
<D00.OP02>
Have you thought about reaching out to someone?
</D00.OP02>
<D00.OP03>
Is there anything I can do to help?
</D00.OP03>

I’ve been doing a lot of negative activities lately, but I can't stop with them.
</D00.01.Text>
<D00.01.OP01>
That’s really not great, what have you been doing?
</D00.01.OP01>
<D00.01.OP02>
Have you tried seeking help?

<D00.02.Text>
I have a lot of addictions and I don’t want to talk about them.
</D00.02.Text>
<D00.02.OP01>
Addictions? That does not sound very healthy.
</D00.02.OP01>
<D00.02.OP02>
What addictions? I can help you get through anything.
</D00.02.OP02>
<D00.02.OP03>
Maybe you should try reaching out to a psychiatrist?

<D00.03.Text>
I haven’t really spoken with anyone about my problem.
</D00.03.Text>
<D00.03.OP01>
You should maybe seek professional help. Some people know how to deal with those kinds of problems.
</D00.03.OP01>
<D00.03.OP02>
Maybe you should. It would benefit you a lot.
</D00.03.OP02>
<D00.03.OP03>
I will try to reach out to someone then.
