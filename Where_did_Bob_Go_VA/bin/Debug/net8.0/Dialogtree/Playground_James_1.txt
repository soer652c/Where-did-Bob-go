Hey, I’m James. Some days, I wonder if I can keep going. Everything feels so pointless.
</D00.Text>
<D00.OP01>
What’s been going on, James?
</D00.OP01>
<D00.OP02>
Do you want to talk about how you’re feeling?
</D00.OP02>
<D00.OP03>
Do you have good days too then?
</D00.OP03>

<D00.01.Text>
It just feels like nothing ever changes. I try, but nothing gets better.
</D00.01.Text>
<D00.01.OP01>
That sounds really hard. Have you talked to anyone about this?
</D00.01.OP01>
<D00.01.OP02>
What’s been the hardest part for you lately?
</D00.01.OP02>
</D00.01>

<D00.02>
<D00.02.Text>
I don’t think anyone can help. I’m just stuck.
</D00.02.Text>
<D00.02.OP01>
You don’t have to keep it all inside, James. People care about you.
</D00.02.OP01>
<D00.02.OP02>
I’m here to listen if you want to share.
</D00.02.OP02>
</D00.02>

<D00.03>
<D00.03.Text>
No, I don’t want to talk about it. It wouldn’t make a difference.
</D00.03.Text>
<D00.03.OP01>
I’m betting it’s going to get better soon enough, just hang in there friend.
</D00.03.OP01>
<D00.03.OP02>
Hopefully. This is just a pain to go through.
</D00.03.OP02>
<D00.03.OP03>
I’ll gladly help you to a good day.
</D00.03.OP03>

<D00.03.01.Text>
They are far in between for sure. Nothing is going my way as of late.
</D00.03.01.Text>
</D00.03.01>

<D00.03.02>
<D00.03.02.Text>
No thank you, I have work things to get done today.
