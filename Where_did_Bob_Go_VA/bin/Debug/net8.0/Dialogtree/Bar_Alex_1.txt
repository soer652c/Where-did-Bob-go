Hey, I’m Alex. I’ve been feeling like everything’s pointless lately.
</D00.Text>
<D00.OP01>
What’s been making you feel this way, Alex?
</D00.OP01>
<D00.OP02>
Do you want to talk about it? I’m here for you.
</D00.OP02>
<D00.OP03>
Have you been doing anything to make you feel better?
</D00.OP03>

I just feel like no matter what I do, nothing ever works out.
</D00.01.Text>
<D00.01.OP01>
That sounds really hard. Have you thought about talking to someone about it?
</D00.01.OP01>
<D00.01.OP02>
I don’t think anyone would be able to help me out of this mess I'm in.

<D00.02.Text>
Just the stress of it all, people annoy me 
and rarely have the energy to talk to anyone.
</D00.02.Text>
<D00.02.OP01>
What’s been the hardest thing to deal with recently?
</D00.02.OP01>
<D00.02.OP02>
I don’t think talking about it will help. It’s just how I’ve been feeling.

<D00.03.Text>
I’m just trying to live, I don’t have either time or money to have fun.
</D00.03.Text>
<D00.03.OP01>
Sometimes it helps just to slow down and talk to your friends or family.
</D00.03.OP01>
<D00.03.OP02>
I honestly don’t think they want to help me with such silly stuff.
</D00.03.OP02>
<D00.03.OP03>
Maybe it’s time to step back and think about yourself a bit.
</D00.03.OP03>

You don’t have to face this alone, Alex. There’s always support.

Sometimes, sharing your feelings can make things feel lighter.
</D00.02.01.Text>
</D00.02.01>

<D00.02.02>
<D00.02.02.Text>
I don’t feel like talking about the bad stuff. 
Thank you for reaching out though.

<D00.03.01.Text>
I have thought about it, but stuff like that takes time and money 
I don’t have.
</D00.03.01.Text>
</D00.03.01>

<D00.03.02>
<D00.03.02.Text>
I don’t have time for that. I gotta get going soon.
