Hi, I’m Mia. Lately, I feel like I’ve lost control over everything in my life.

<D00.OP01>
What’s been happening, Mia?
</D00.OP01>
<D00.OP02>
Would you like to talk about what’s making you feel this way?
</D00.OP02>
<D00.OP03>
If you want to talk about it, I'll gladly listen.

I’ve been struggling to keep up with school and friends. I feel like I’m failing at everything.
</D00.01.Text>
<D00.01.OP01>
It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Have you talked to anyone about this?
</D00.01.OP01>
<D00.01.OP02>
What’s been the hardest thing to deal with lately?

<D00.02.Text>
I just feel like I can’t keep pretending everything is fine anymore.
</D00.02.Text>
<D00.02.OP01>
Sometimes, sharing can help you feel less alone. I’m here to listen.
</D00.02.OP01>
<D00.02.OP02>
You don’t have to go through this alone. There are people who care about you.
</D00.02.OP02>

<D00.03>
<D00.03.Text>
I’m not sure it would help. I’ve been feeling this way for a while.
</D00.03.Text>
<D00.03.OP01>
I’m sure talking about it would ease some of the pressure.
</D00.03.OP01>
<D00.03.OP02>
That’s fair, I don’t want to pressure you further. It was nice bumping into you.
</D00.03.OP02>
</D00.03>

<D00.01.01>
<D00.01.01.Text>
I have been bottling it all up instead. It makes me able to keep going.
</D00.01.01.Text>
</D00.01.01>

<D00.01.02>
<D00.01.02.Text>
I don’t feel like talking about it; I have to focus on my schoolwork.
</D00.01.02.Text>
</D00.01.02>

<D00.02.01>
<D00.02.01.Text>
Maybe I’ll try... but it’s so hard to open up.
</D00.02.01.Text>
</D00.02.01>

<D00.02.02>
<D00.02.02.Text>
I’m not sure you would be able to help one bit. I just want to be left alone.
</D00.02.02.Text>
</D00.02.02>

<D00.03.01>
<D00.03.01.Text>
Like I said, I don’t want to talk about it any further.
</D00.03.01.Text>
</D00.03.01>

<D00.03.02>
<D00.03.02.Text>
Yes, you too. See ya.
