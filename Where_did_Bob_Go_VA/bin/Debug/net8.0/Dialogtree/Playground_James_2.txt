I’ve been feeling overwhelmed by work and responsibilities.
</D00.01.Text>
<D00.01.OP01>
That sounds stressful. Have you thought about delegating some tasks?
</D00.01.OP01>
<D00.01.OP02>
What do you usually do when things get overwhelming?

I just keep pushing through, even though it’s getting harder.

<D00.02.OP01>
Sometimes it’s okay to take a break. Have you had some time to rest?
</D00.02.OP01>
<D00.02.OP02>
Maybe you should consider talking to someone about how you’re feeling.

We could go for a walk and talk then?
</D00.03.Text>
<D00.03.OP01>
Let us do so!
</D00.03.OP01>
<D00.03.OP02>
You can call me anytime; I’ll happily help.
