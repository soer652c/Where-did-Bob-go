Hey, I’m Ben. I’m doing okay, 
but some days it’s hard to keep my head above water.

What’s been making things tough for you?
</D00.OP01>
<D00.OP02>
Have you been able to find time for yourself?
</D00.OP02>
<D00.OP03>
Have you thought about what to do in those situations?
</D00.OP03>

I’ve been struggling to find balance between work and personal life.

<D00.01.OP01>
Balancing everything can be tough. Have you tried taking breaks?
</D00.01.OP01>
<D00.01.OP02>
What do you do to relax when things get overwhelming?

<D00.02.Text>
I’ve been keeping myself busy to avoid dealing with how I feel.
</D00.02.Text>
<D00.02.OP01>
It can be tempting to stay busy, but are you giving yourself a chance to rest?
</D00.02.OP01>
<D00.02.OP02>
Maybe it’s time to focus on what’s making you feel this way.

<D00.03>
<D00.03.Text>
I haven’t really.
</D00.03.Text>
<D00.03.OP01>
You should find something relaxing and fun to do in those situations.
</D00.03.OP01>
<D00.03.OP02>
You should talk with someone you love.
</D00.03.OP02>
</D00.03>

<D00.03.01>
<D00.03.01.Text>
Yeah, I will think about it.
