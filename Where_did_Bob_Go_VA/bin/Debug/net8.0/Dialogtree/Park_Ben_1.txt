Hey, I’m Ben. I don’t know how to keep going some days. It feels like everything’s falling apart.

<D00.OP01>
What’s been happening? You don’t have to face it alone.
</D00.OP01>
<D00.OP02>
Have you told anyone how you’re feeling?
</D00.OP02>
<D00.OP03>
You look like someone who’s troubled.

I’m losing interest in everything I used to care about. It’s all so exhausting.
</D00.01.Text>
<D00.01.OP01>
It’s okay to feel exhausted. Maybe you could talk to someone about it?
</D00.01.OP01>
<D00.01.OP02>
What’s making you feel so drained?
</D00.01.OP02>

<D00.02.Text>
No, I don’t want to burden anyone. I’m just dealing with it on my own.
</D00.02.Text>
<D00.02.OP01>
You don’t have to carry this burden alone, Ben. People care about you.
</D00.02.OP01>
<D00.02.OP02>
Have you thought about reaching out for some support?

<D00.03.Text>
Yeah, life has been stressing me out the last couple of weeks.
</D00.03.Text>
<D00.03.OP01>
Have you tried to take a break away from everything?
</D00.03.OP01>
<D00.03.OP02>
You should destress.
</D00.03.OP02>
</D00.03>

<D00.03.01>
<D00.03.01.Text>
Sure, I will figure something out.
