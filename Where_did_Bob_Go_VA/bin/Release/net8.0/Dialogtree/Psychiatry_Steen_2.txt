Hey, I’m Steen. I’ve been having a bad day today.
</D00.Text>

<D00.OP01>
Why are you having a bad day?
</D00.OP01>

<D00.OP02>
What have you done to solve your problem?
</D00.OP02>

<D00.OP03>
Oh, that is not great. Do you want to talk with somebody?
</D00.OP03>
</D00>

<D00.01>
<D00.01.Text>
My partner left me, so I don’t feel so great today.
</D00.01.Text>

<D00.01.OP01>
Oh, that is unfortunate. Hopefully, you will find someone better.
</D00.01.OP01>

<D00.01.OP02>
Oh, that is not great. 
You should take some time to yourself to cheer yourself up.
</D00.01.OP02>

<D00.01.01>
<D00.01.01.Text>
Maybe.
</D00.01.01.Text>
</D00.01.01>

<D00.01.02>
<D00.01.02.Text>
I think you’re right. I’ll try to get some rest.
</D00.01.02.Text>
</D00.01.02>

<D00.02>
<D00.02.Text>
There is nothing I can do.
</D00.02.Text>

<D00.02.OP01>
You are right, but remember that you will feel better over time.
</D00.02.OP01>

<D00.02.OP02>
I think you are wrong. 
There are many things you can do to cheer yourself up.
</D00.02.OP02>
</D00.02>

<D00.02.01>
<D00.02.01.Text>
I don’t know. I will think about it.
</D00.02.01.Text>
</D00.02.01>

<D00.02.02>
<D00.02.02.Text>
Thanks, I will figure something out.
</D00.02.02.Text>
</D00.02.02>

<D00.03>
<D00.03.Text>
Well, who should I talk to?
</D00.03.Text>

<D00.03.OP01>
You could talk to a friend.
</D00.03.OP01>

<D00.03.OP02>
You could talk with me.
</D00.03.OP02>
</D00.03>

<D00.03.01>
<D00.03.01.Text>
Yeah... maybe you are right about that. I will try that.
</D00.03.01.Text>
</D00.03.01>

<D00.03.02>
<D00.03.02.Text>
I will ask someone else.
</D00.03.02.Text>
